# People Finder

## Motivation

My motivation for this app is because we had a similar tool a few years ago at my company and IT decided to stop supporting it so it was sunsetted. I used it heavily when I was moving around from office to office and was dissapointed to see it go away. Alt

## Status

The app is now connected to the database instead of pulling in local data and is fully functioning. npm
